# Analyzing Gym Attendance Patterns to Optimize Staffing

## Overview
This project analyzes gym attendance data to optimize staffing schedules. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, predictive modeling using time series forecasting, and clustering to understand patterns in gym usage.

## Project Structure
- **data_analysis.ipynb**: The main notebook containing the analysis.
- **data/**: Directory containing the dataset (if applicable).
- **results/**: Directory for storing generated plots and forecast results.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required libraries: `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook: `data_analysis.ipynb`.

## Key Insights
- Peak hours for gym attendance are between 6 AM - 9 AM and 5 PM - 8 PM.
- The most frequent visitors are in the 26-35 age group.
- Time series forecasting indicates an upward trend in attendance.

## Staffing Recommendations
Based on the analysis, it is recommended to allocate more staff during peak hours to manage the influx of gym-goers effectively.
