Project Title: Analyzing the Relationship Between Project Budget and Cost Overruns
Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze how the initial budget of construction projects affects the magnitude of cost overruns. By understanding this relationship, you can gain insights into the factors that lead to budget overruns and improve budget forecasting and project management in the construction industry.

Background: In construction projects, staying within the allocated budget is a critical measure of success. However, it’s common for projects to exceed their initial budgets due to various factors such as unexpected costs, delays, changes in scope, and inefficiencies. This project aims to quantify the relationship between the budget and the likelihood or extent of cost overruns, which can help in identifying potential risk factors and areas for improvement in budgeting practices.

Dataset: Assume you have a CSV file named construction_budget_costs.csv. The dataset might look like this:

Project_ID	Project_Type	Initial_Budget	Final_Cost	Cost_Overrun
1	Residential	500000	550000	50000
2	Commercial	1500000	1450000	-50000
3	Infrastructure	3000000	3300000	300000
4	Residential	600000	650000	50000
5	Commercial	1200000	1350000	150000
Columns:

Project_ID: Unique identifier for each project.
Project_Type: The type of project (e.g., Residential, Commercial, Infrastructure).
Initial_Budget: The budget allocated at the start of the project (in dollars).
Final_Cost: The actual cost incurred by the end of the project (in dollars).
Cost_Overrun: The difference between the Final Cost and the Initial Budget (in dollars). Positive values indicate a budget overrun, while negative values indicate that the project was completed under budget.
Project Workflow:

Data Loading and Preparation:

Load the dataset into a pandas DataFrame.
Handle any missing or inconsistent data, ensuring that numeric columns are correctly typed.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate summary statistics to understand the distribution of budgets, costs, and overruns.
Visualize the distribution of cost overruns across different project types.
Explore how often projects exceed their budget and by how much.
Correlation Analysis:

Calculate the correlation between the initial budget and the cost overrun to understand if larger budgets tend to have larger overruns.
Perform a linear regression analysis to model the relationship between the initial budget and cost overruns, assessing how much of the variance in cost overruns can be explained by the initial budget.
Visualization:

Create visualizations such as scatter plots, histograms, and boxplots to illustrate the relationship between project budgets and cost overruns.
Use regression plots to show the fitted model line for budget vs. cost overrun.
Statistical Analysis:

Perform statistical tests (e.g., ANOVA) to determine if the means of cost overruns differ significantly between different project types.
Analyze the residuals of the regression model to check for any patterns or anomalies.
Reporting and Insights:

Summarize the findings, including which types of projects are more prone to budget overruns and how the initial budget size relates to the likelihood and size of these overruns.
Provide recommendations for improving budget forecasts and managing risks in construction projects.
Potential Insights:

Projects with larger initial budgets might be more prone to higher absolute cost overruns, but smaller projects might have a higher percentage overrun relative to their budget.
Certain types of projects (e.g., infrastructure) might be more susceptible to overruns due to their complexity.
The regression analysis might reveal a significant positive correlation between the initial budget and cost overruns, suggesting that higher budgets could lead to higher absolute overruns.
Practical Applications:

Construction firms can use these insights to adjust their budgeting strategies, particularly for large-scale or high-risk projects.
Project managers can identify early warning signs of potential overruns based on initial budget sizes and allocate resources more effectively.
The analysis can help in refining cost estimation processes by considering the factors that historically led to overruns.Project Structure:

1. Data Loading and Preparation:
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('data/construction_budget_costs.csv')

# Display the first few rows
print(data.head())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())

# Drop missing values
data.dropna(inplace=True)

# Ensure numeric columns are correctly typed
data['Initial_Budget'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Initial_Budget'], errors='coerce')
data['Final_Cost'] = pd.to_numeric(data['Final_Cost'], errors='coerce')
data['Cost_Overrun'] = data['Final_Cost'] - data['Initial_Budget']

# Preview the cleaned data
print(data.head())

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
# Summary statistics
print(data.describe())

# Distribution of cost overruns
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.histplot(data['Cost_Overrun'], kde=True, color='blue')
plt.title('Distribution of Cost Overruns')
plt.xlabel('Cost Overrun (Dollars)')

# Scatter plot of initial budget vs. cost overrun
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.scatterplot(x='Initial_Budget', y='Cost_Overrun', hue='Project_Type', data=data, palette='Set1')

from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Calculate the correlation between initial budget and cost overrun
correlation = data[['Initial_Budget', 'Cost_Overrun']].corr().iloc[0, 1]

# Prepare data for regression analysis
X = data[['Initial_Budget']]
y = data['Cost_Overrun']

# Split data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)
